TODO
1. optimize front end user promt to accept conjunctive query from user (not necessary)

2. genre type are conjunctive；category is inconsistent, category is inconsistent

3. prepare slides, show our schemas, db relations. Example queries, unfording processes


An working example:

Select all the name of the romantic movies casted by straight actors who have nominated an Oscar award

ans(mv_name)<-Movie(mv_id,mv_name,_,”Romance”,_,_,_),
Principal(mv_id,p_id,“actor”),
Nominee(p_id,p_name,_,_,_,_,_,”Straight”,“FALSE”)

                
                Movie,Principal,Nominee

                For Movie:
                _,_,_,"Romance",_,_,_
                
                For Principal:
                _,_,"actor"    
                
                For Nominee:
                _,_,_,_,_,_,_,"Straight","FALSE"  
                
                

The final joint sql query looks like:

SELECT *
FROM
    (SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...) t1
    INNER JOIN
    (SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...) t2
    ON t1.key = t2.key
    INNER JOIN
    (SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...) t3
    ON t2.key = t3.ket
;
